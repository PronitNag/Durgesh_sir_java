# Classes and Objects in Programming

- **Classes** are only blueprints for objects.
- Variables are called **data members/properties** (each object has its own copy). Basically, instance variables.
- Methods are called **member methods/behaviors.** Executed in object spaces (talking about instance/non-static methods)
